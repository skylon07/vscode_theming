## 1.0.3

Hotfix for a bug introduced in the new "uncapturing" mechanism.

(Oh, that was a new feature in the last version, by the way.)


## 1.0.2

Fix some normalization bugs.


## 1.0.1

Version bump, to (hopefully) synchronize files.


## 1.0.0

Initial release. It has all the features I wanted (at the time) and all bugs fixed (that I knew about).
